    <p>Hello, I'm Long. I am an aspiring developer hoping to contribute to something great starting from the front-end and working my way to
    becoming a full-stack developer who is always working on something new and cool every day!</p>
    <p>This is my portfolio page that I've created to showcase some of the cool projects that I've worked on.
    Hopefully you will have a look around and be interested enough to contact me for more information.</p>
    <p>I prefer simplicity and that is reflected in the colour palette and layout of this webpage. It takes away distractions and allows you to
    focus on the actual information or products being promoted. However, I do see the appeal as well in more complex and intricate designs.</p>
    <p>If you want to know more about me, you can reach me at <b>longmnn@gmail.com</b>, no it’s not a typo, longmann@gmail.com was not available ☹,
    or find out more on the contacts details link above.</p>
    <p>Anyways I thank you for having shown interest and having read this far,
    I hope you have a nice day and I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
